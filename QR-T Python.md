# Python
_Reminders:_

**Print**
- `print()`
- Print function used to tell a computer to talk; should be surrounded by quotes -- _doesn't matter if they're single or double._ 
---
**Variables**
- `message_string = "Hello"`
- Assign variables by using the equal sign 
- Can't have spaces or symbols in their name other than an underscore. 
- Can't begin with numbers by they can have numbers after the first letter (`this_cool_variable_5`)
---
**Numbers**
- _Integer_ or `int` is a whole number with no decimal points and contains all counting numbers along with the negative counterparts and 0. 
- A `float` is a decimal number that can be used to represent fractional quantities as well as precise measurements. 

> `an_int = 2`
`a_float = 2.1`
`print(an_int + 3)`
---
**Errors**
- _SyntaxError_
   - Something wrong with the way the program is written
- _NameError_
  - code that contains something that looks like a variable but was never defined.

----

**Naming Conventions**

- A good rule of thumb is to use the **CapWord** convention so a class would be defined as `TheDog` instead of `The_dog`. 

> `class TheDog`
    - - - -`def_init_(self,name):`
    - - - -`self.name = name` 

- _Functions_ should be in all lowercase and underscores should be used to seperate words when necessary. 
- _Variable_ names should follow the same rules as functions. 
---
**Indentation**
- There should always be **4 spaces per indentation**; spaces are preferred over tabs when making indentations.
