# K8

## API
- most important component of k8 cluster
- communication with the cluster uses this 
- every user and component of the cluster needs the api-server

## Access Control Overview
- before a request if processed, it goes through three stages

**Authentication > Authorization > Admission Control**

| Authentication | Authorization | Admission Control | 
| ----- | ---- | ---- |
| Requester needs to present a means of identity against the API. Normally done with a digital certificate or external identity manager. K8 users are always externally managed. | Decided what the requester is allowed to do. In k8, this is done with Role Based Access Control (RBAC). | Admission controllers can be used to modify/validate the request. Tools like Open Policy Agent can be used to manage admission control externally | 

> K8 API is implemented as a RESTful interface that is exposed over HTTPS. Through the API, a user or service can create, modify, delete or retrieve resources that reside in K8.

## Running Containers on K8
- you define Pods as the smallest compute unite
- K8 translates that into a running container
- when creating a pod object in k8, several components are involved in that process
